# Coherence Check

### Description - So we're up to date, we've moved away from using s*nity check. Here's your flag.


Initially, this challenge may seem super simple, type out the flag you get in the image below.

![Coherence Check](src/coherencerarctf.png)

Sure, this will work and give you the flag of `rarctf{Welcome_To_RaRCTF!}`, however, in design of an interesting Coherence Check, I decided to go Down The Rabbit Hole, and add an extra easter egg never seen before in the land of Capture the Flag Coherence Checks - Steganography.

I decided to skip the 3 common pillars of CTF Steganography - Binwalk, Steghide and Strings. The next thing that I thought of was metadata, so I decided to create some.

For those with access to a command line, `exiftool` is great for metadata related problems. (can just be installed with `sudo apt install exiftool` for those with the apt package manager.)

Simply running `exiftool [filename]` will bring us something interesting, as shown below.
```

Most of this is irrelevant, but the author (me!) left a note in the description of the metadata, stating ` if you see this, DM jammy#0402 on discord secret_stego for a special role!` If you DMd jammy#0402, you would have received the Rabbithole Enthusiast role on the RaRCTF discord. Congrats to the below people for actually finding this:
