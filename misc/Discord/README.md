# Discord

### Description - Come to our discord, and we'll give you a free flag for your trouble. Discord invite: https://discord.gg/VMWvNW36Zx

### Note: While it is optional to join our discord, we will be posting challenge updates + announcements there first, so it is highly recommended to join.

A simple discord challenge, you need to verify with the reaction bot, then run `!flag` in the spam discord channel.

### Alternative solve

[Rarmony](pwn/Rarmony), our CTF chat platform challenge, also had its own version of the discord flag, in the `general` channel. To get this flag, follow the below steps:

After careful looking, we see a message from Tony stating:

`in order to fully finish our discord migration, i've decided to repost the discord flag of rarctf{wh3n_4r3_w3-m0v1ng_b4ck_t0-IRC?_29ff18a15e}`

This flag matches up from what you would get from running !flag in the spam channel.
#### Flag: rarctf{wh3n_4r3_w3-m0v1ng_b4ck_t0-IRC?_29ff18a15e}
